This project implements the First Fit Algorithm for dynamic memory allocation using Java. The First Fit Algorithm sequentially allocates memory to processes by finding the first memory block large enough to accommodate the process. If no block is suitable, the process is marked as "Not Allocated." The program demonstrates memory management concepts, including allocation, fragmentation, and dynamic block size updates.
